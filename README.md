# GradientDescent
GradientDescentSimulation(s)

This is a lovely little piece of code that generates images. Those images represent the path of the point that descends the speetest way to the local minimum of the function.
It is very simple, because I had a rush thought of making this.
The hardcoded function is x^2 + y^2, but you can chage it easily. Just make sure you count your derivatives right. Change the return value in "calcEquation" and chose a point that belongs to that plane. 

You can change amount of frames (images) that it will generate by changing "Amount_of_frames".

You can quickly make it so it shows just the end effect in no time.
